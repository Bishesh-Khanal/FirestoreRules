# FirestoreRules

I have successfully implemented a role-based CRUD operations requirement by defining granular Firestore security rules that restrict create and delete operations to users with the 'admin' role only, while allowing update operations for both 'admin' and 'editor' roles, and read access for any authenticated user. The rules leverage Firebase Auth custom claims (request.auth.token.role) to enforce role-based access control, which is complemented by my test script that creates users with different roles ('admin', 'editor', 'viewer') and systematically validates that each role can only perform the operations they're authorized for according to the security rules: effectively demonstrating proper data validation and role checks for all CRUD operations in Firestore.
